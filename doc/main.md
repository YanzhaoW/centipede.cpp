# Introduction

Centipede is a program that implements Millepede method in C++. It's designed to be fast with a flexible API, using the latest C++ standard and other modern programming techniques, such as multithreading and task scheduling. The high performance of this library is achieved by utilizing the Eigen3 library for the matrix operations.

The program provides both a library and a CLI executable for the backward compatibility to the old Millepede-II program.
